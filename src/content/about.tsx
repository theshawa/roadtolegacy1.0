        90% of the 1st year IT undergraduates do not have an idea about the IT
        industry. Most of them certainly donâ€™t have an idea about where they
        want to go. Most just flows with the degree program.
        <br />
        <br />
        What if 1st year students had an aim of where they want to go ? What if
        they kept working towards that aim for the next 3 - 4 years ? How much
        better will they be at the end of the 3rd / 4th year?
        <br />
        <br />
        We can give them a glimpse into the future, what each domain looks like,
        what arethe major job roles, what to do in those roles using some real
        world cases, what arethe skills needed to excel in that and how to
        develop them in the next 3 / 4 years..
